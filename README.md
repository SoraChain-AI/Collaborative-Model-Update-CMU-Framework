# Collaborative-Model-Update-CMU-Framework
Collaborative Model Update framework on blockchain on Sharing Updatable Models is a framework to host and train publicly available machine learning models.

SoraChain AI utilizes Collaborative Model Update (CMU) framework along with Blockchain. CMU on blockchain framework will be used for sharing and training decentralized machine learning models. Using the model to get predictions for data is approximately free because the model is public. We are facilitating crowdsourcing on the blockchain; allowing people to easily and transparently improve the models they use in everyday products.

CMU models on blockchain refers to the process of distributing and updating machine learning models via a blockchain network. 

# Framework Process

# Tokenization of Models: 
Initially, the machine learning model is tokenized, meaning it is represented as a unique cryptographic token on the blockchain network. This token serves as a digital representation of the model.

# Smart Contracts for Model Management: 
Smart contracts are deployed on the blockchain to manage the ownership, distribution, and update of the model. These smart contracts contain rules and logic governing how the model can be accessed, used, and updated by different parties.

# Decentralized Storage and Access: 
The model is stored in a decentralized manner on the blockchain network, ensuring that it is accessible to authorized users from anywhere in the world. Users can interact with the model by sending transactions to the blockchain network, triggering predefined actions encoded in the smart contracts.

# Permissioned Access: 
Access to the model may be permissioned, meaning that only authorized users or entities are allowed to use or update the model. Smart contracts enforce access control rules, ensuring that only authenticated users can interact with the model and that their actions are recorded on the blockchain.

# Model Updates and Versioning: 
When updates or improvements are made to the model, a new version of the model is created and tokenized on the blockchain. Smart contracts manage the transition between different versions of the model, ensuring that users can seamlessly switch to the latest version without disrupting their workflows.

# Immutable Record of Changes: 
Every update to the model is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain, creating an immutable record of changes. This transparent audit trail allows users to trace the evolution of the model over time and verify the authenticity and integrity of each version.

Using our framework, organizations can facilitate collaborative model development, ensure transparency and accountability in model management, and provide a secure and decentralized platform for distributing machine learning capabilities. This approach offers numerous benefits, including enhanced trust, interoperability, and efficiency in the deployment of machine learning solutions.
